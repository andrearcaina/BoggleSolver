# Pyggle

Find all possible words given a board and words, with a visual representation of the algorithm!
Check `lib` for package details. For an example on how to use pyggle, check `lib/examples/example.py`!

Will modify so:

- it will show on the screen
- will visualize the representation of the algorithm (like an example section)
