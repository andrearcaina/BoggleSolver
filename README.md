# Pyggle

Find all possible words given a board and words, with a visual representation of the algorithm!
`backend/api/boggle.py` returns a dictionary of all possible words with coordinates of each character.

Will modify so:

- it will show on the screen
- will visualize the representation of the algorithm (like an example section)
